To-DO-List
=============================

This webapp is my attempt to understand the Google App Engine infrastructure. This simple app helps
user create to do lists and organize them in Notes. 
It is functional but missing many essential features like checking Note name uniqueness, deleting notes
and error reporting. The front end could use some beautification. I would also like to try AJAX.
